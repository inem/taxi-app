Implementation notes
====================
I decided not to take rails for this small task.
There are two sinatra apps + one sidekiq worker
Rake task is simple one-liner

Implementation is naive and doesn't cover lots of edge cases. Authentication is also primitive - you just pass password as plain text.

TODO:
====
Just realized that I get some requirements incorrectly.
So:
1. Password should be generated _based_ on phone â†’ this will affect current authentication schema
2. Drivers should have name
3. Details of booking should include driver name and phone


Setup
=====

```
bundle install
ruby schema.rb
rake generate_drivers

ruby booking_app.rb
ruby assignment_app.rb -p 4568
bundle exec sidekiq -r ./sms_sender.rb
```

create booking:
  http://localhost:4567/booking/create/8923749824
